# IntoTheCrypt
Into the Crypt was a small game developed with the challenge of level generation. The idea was to create a horror game where you had to search a maze to find artifacts. Every time you started a new game a new map would generate creating a new layout.
Design:
The idea behind creating a new level was to separate the map into a grid and put a pair of points on the map. Each point would have an artifact and would be connected together. The game randomly chooses how many points it adds and then checks to make sure it is possible  to get to every spot.
